# Firebase Blog made with create-react-app

This repository contains a blog I made for my friend.

This blog uses components from Material-UI and Firebase for storing Blog Posts, Hosting, user authentication.

The app contains protected routes only accessable through login by the Blog owner and I, and contains a blog post editor made with TinyMCE.
